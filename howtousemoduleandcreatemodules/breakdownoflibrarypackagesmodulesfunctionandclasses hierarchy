Library:
A library is a collection of modules and/or packages that provide reusable code.
(Not all libraries are organized into packages, but many are.)

Packages:
Packages are directories containing a collection of modules (and possibly subpackages). They help organize related modules.

Modules:
Modules are single files (typically with a .py extension) that contain Python code, such as functions, classes, and variables.

Functions:
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task.

They are defined with parameters (placeholders) and are called with arguments (actual values).
Classes:
Classes are blueprints for creating objects.

They have attributes (data) and methods (functions defined inside a class).
The class's constructor method (typically __init__) can accept parameters to initialize the object, but the class itself is not described as having parameters.
So, a more precise breakdown would be:

A library can have packages.
Packages contain modules.
Modules include functions and classes.
Functions have parameters (in their definition) and receive arguments when called.
Classes have attributes (and methods), and their constructor methods can take parameters to initialize new objects.
