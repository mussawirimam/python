Q: does each module have its own way of handling try and except?
A: Yes, each module (or more generally, each type of operation) in Python may have its own way of handling exceptions, but the structure of try and except blocks remains the same across modules. However, different modules or types of errors may require different kinds of exception handling or different error classes, and the exceptions they raise may be more specific or more general.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. General Syntax of try and except:
In Python, the syntax for try and except is the same regardless of the module or the operation:

try:
    # Code that might throw an exception
except SomeSpecificException as e:
    # Handle the exception

2. Different Exceptions per Module:
Although the structure is the same, different modules in Python raise different types of exceptions. Each module may raise its own set of exception classes for specific errors.

Examples:

a. File Operations (open, os module)

Exceptions: FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, OSError, etc.
Handling:

try:
    with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"File not found: {e}")
except PermissionError as e:
    print(f"Permission error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

b. Network Operations (requests module)

Exceptions: requests.exceptions.RequestException, requests.exceptions.Timeout, requests.exceptions.HTTPError, etc.
Handling:

import requests
try:
    response = requests.get("https://example.com")
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad responses (4xx, 5xx)
except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
    print(f"Request timed out: {e}")
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {e}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


c. Subprocess Operations (subprocess module)

Exceptions: subprocess.CalledProcessError, FileNotFoundError, etc.
Handling:

import subprocess
try:
    result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Command failed with error: {e.stderr}")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Command not found: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


d. Database Operations (e.g., sqlite3)

Exceptions: sqlite3.OperationalError, sqlite3.DatabaseError, etc.
Handling:

import sqlite3
try:
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM non_existent_table")
except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
    print(f"Database operation failed: {e}")
except sqlite3.DatabaseError as e:
    print(f"Database error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


3. Common Patterns in Exception Handling:
Catch Specific Exceptions: It's often best to catch the specific exception that is likely to occur for the operation. For example, catching FileNotFoundError when dealing with file operations.
Fallback to Exception: If you're unsure about the specific exceptions or want to handle anything unexpected, use Exception as a fallback. However, be careful as it can sometimes mask other issues.
Multiple except Blocks: You can have multiple except blocks for different types of exceptions, or use a more general except for unexpected cases.


4. Finally Block:
A finally block is often used across modules to guarantee that some code is executed no matter what (whether an exception is raised or not). It's commonly used for cleanup tasks like closing files or network connections.

try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except SomeSpecificException:
    # Handle exception
finally:
    # Code that will run no matter what
    print("This runs no matter what.")


Summary:
While the basic structure of try and except is the same in all cases, the specific exceptions that you need to catch (and how you handle them) depend on the module and operation you are dealing with. It's always best practice to catch the most specific exception first, then more general ones later, and finally use a finally block when cleanup is required.
