# what is iterable and iterator
# Iterable: It's like a container (e.g., a list or a string) that holds many items and can be looped through. Think of it as a box of chocolates where you can take one chocolate at a time.
#Iterator: It's a tool that helps you go through the items in an iterable, one by one. Once you've gone through everything, it stops. Itâ€™s like using a tool to take each chocolate from the box, one by one, until the box is empty.
#The iterable is the container, and the iterator is the tool that helps you take out the items from that container.
"""
commented code below is to learn what is iterable and what is not iterable. Find the difference between the two.
def thisisstring(string):
    #print("This is my input function")
    x = string
    return x
## now I will create function that will the input for the above function 
def print_string_input():
    user_input = input("Enter a string:")
    result = thisisstring(user_input)
    print(result)
### this is how we will call the function below:
print_string_input()

for x in print_string_input:
    print(x)


#    for x in print_string_input: 
#TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable
The error you're seeing, TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable, occurs because you are trying to iterate over a function (print_string_input), which is not allowed. In Python, you can only iterate over iterable objects such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, etc.

If your intention is to iterate over the result returned by thisisstring, you need to modify the code slightly. Here's how to fix it:

"""
def thisisstring(string):
    # Return the input string
    x = string
    return x

def print_string_input():
    # Ask the user for input
    user_input = input("Enter a string: ")
    
    # Call the thisisstring function and return the result
    return thisisstring(user_input)

# Call the function and store the result
result = print_string_input()

# Iterate over the result if it's a string and print each character
for x in result:
    print(x.capitalize())

### variable is a way of packing data into a single entity.
